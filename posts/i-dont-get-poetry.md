# I don't "get" poetry

This was a writing prompt for blogvember.

...segway...???

The code poems. Most of them are `if (sad) { be_happy() }`, live-laught-wine
type shit but some of them kinda hit different. One about "Love Sady" was pretty
intruiging for lack of a better term. There was just something about the intent
of the programmer. 1701998444 (not nhentai i swear)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int n = 1701998444;

int main()
{
	int i = 0;

	while (i < n) {
		putc(((n >> (i % 4) * 8) & 0xff) +
		      4 * ((int) (i % 8 % 7) / 6),
		      stdout);
		i++;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

The little haiku from [_365 - et år i haiku_][365-haiku] (en: 365 – a year in
haiku)

> Skoven tyst og kold\
> ravnens solitære ra\
> jeg holder vejret

The tiger is free.

Perhaps there just isn't as much to poerty as I once thought. Maybe I don't have
to "get" poetry, I just have to enjoy it. That sounds cliché but I honestly
didn't realise this until this prompt (and the disourse around it) made me
really think about this. something, something, hearing how other people approach
poetry I thought there was some intellectual (as in: consious thought) required
to truly "get" poetry.

Is school to blame for making me think I have to understand every piece of art
on an intellectual level.

I quite enjoyed that trans-humanist thing at ARoS, maybe include that?

Maybe the same goes for all kinds of media. There doesn't have to be this whole
intellectual understandig, if the work hits.
