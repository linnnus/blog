# My Second post

The next paragraph will be generated by the `!!` directive.

!! echo "This paragraph was generated by the special !! directive"

Watch this! I'll do it again. The current working directory is...

```sh
!! pwd
```

Here are some numbers to simulate a long post.

!! for x in $(seq 1 100); do
!!   echo "- $x"
!! done
