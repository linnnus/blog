# Longing for community

There's this tweet that has been stuck in my head lately.

; "like-minded persons" sounds lame af
I used to be part of a tight-knit online community and it was such a gratifying experience.
For a few cozy years it felt like I was the dream we were promised in the 90's.
The dream of a web where you could connect with like-minded persons from all over the world unrestricted by age, gender, or physical location.

We built stuff for each other in that community.
Some of it was silly, some of it was useful, all of it was [situated software].
It felt like the code had a soul.
Sometimes we purposefully didn't refactor a clumsy/slow piece of code
because it was associated with a particularly fun in-joke
or because someone was very proud of an algorithm they'd made.
Using a video call and [Live Share] to collaboratively edit source was some of the most fun I've ever had on a computer.

; It was social software as much in its development as in its use.

As I write this, I keep wanting to use that same word: 'gratifying'.
I think that word so perfectly captures the vibe of
knowing the in-jokes,
having relationships to other members,
and feeling like your voice mattered.

That community eventually died.
Not from some devastating event, just slowly over time as people's attention shifted.
I've been trying to recreate that same feeling of belonging over on Cohost[^me] by
posting frequently,
interacting with other people's posts,
commenting on posts,
all that jazz.
But I worry [Cohost] might be to loosely coupled a community.
Social media just isn't the same as the semi-public space of a chat room[^self-deprecating].

[Cohost]: https://cohost.org/
[^me]: I'm [@linuwus](https://cohost.org/linuwus). Feel free to send and ask and say hello!
[^self-deprecating]: Or maybe people just don't want to talk to me, idk.
